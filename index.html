      It has been suggested that beautiful and usable websites are created on a
      foundation of beautiful and usable typography. That makes it a pretty
      important element that you will want to look at very carefully.
      Fortunately, CSS offers a variety of styling options that allow you a
      great deal of control over how your present your content to your viewers
      and users. This demo - which is entirely driven by CSS - is built to
      demonstrate the step by step development of attractive typography, moving
      from basic HTML to fully styled content. You can use the buttons at the
      top of the page to view the content in various stages of styling, from
      completely unstyled to the completed design. Please feel free to have a
      bit of fun by working through the various stages.Created: May 13, 2010
